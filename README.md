## Emacs config

This repo contains my Emacs configuration for Clojure development. 

It is a fork of [Bozhidar's Emacs config](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs.d) project, with some additional config in the custom.el.

Tested with GNU Emacs 26.1 (build 1, x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.24.32) of 2018-06-29.
